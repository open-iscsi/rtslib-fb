rtslib-fb

rtslib-fb ("free branch") is a tree that tracks RTS's upstream
git repo, but with additional patches. Like the upstream version,
these patches are available under AGPLv3, but sole copyright no longer
belongs to RTS, since additional patch copyrights are still held by
their respective authors.
